# Intro

According to the book I am writing on prompt engineering based on YT videos, I have asked the same question to ChatGPT but with a longer prompt instead of just saying "What is Javascript"

Here is the prompt : Generate a 100-word article for a personal developement blog that provides a comprehensive guide to learn javascript. The article should cover the basic concepts of javascript, and be writtent in a clear style accessible to a general audience. To support your article utilize specialised articles and books. Incorporate examples to illustrate the article

After that I just have asked ChatGPT to generate a heading

I didn't used any iteration yet, so here is what I have got

JavaScript is a popular programming language used to create interactive websites, web applications, and mobile applications. Learning JavaScript is essential for web developers, and it is not as daunting as it may seem. Here is a comprehensive guide to learn JavaScript.

Start with the Basics: Before diving into the advanced topics, it is essential to understand the basics. Learn about variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and functions. This will lay the foundation for learning advanced concepts.

Get Hands-on Practice: Practice is key to learning JavaScript. Start by creating simple projects such as a calculator, a clock, or a quiz. As you progress, you can move on to more complex projects.

Learn the DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) is an essential concept in JavaScript. It is a programming interface for web documents. Understanding how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript is crucial for creating interactive web pages.

Understand Asynchronous Programming: Asynchronous programming is a programming pattern used in JavaScript. It enables code to run without blocking other code from executing. This concept is critical in creating responsive web applications.

Utilize Resources: There are many resources available to help you learn JavaScript. Utilize online tutorials, books, and specialized articles. Some recommended resources include "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan and the Mozilla Developer Network.

In conclusion, learning JavaScript can seem overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. Start with the basics, get hands-on practice, understand the DOM, and learn asynchronous programming. Utilize resources to help you learn and stay up-to-date on the latest trends in web development. Happy coding!
